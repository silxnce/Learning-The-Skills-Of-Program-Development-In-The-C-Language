# Task 1

Develop an algorithm and implement a program to solve the problem when entering variable values from the keyboard. Calculate:  
1. x = a^2 * e^(-(a/b)^2)
2. y = arctg(sqrt((4*k/(a^2 * c))^(-1)))

# Task 2

Create an algorithm and a program that uses a loop to determine the formula to be applied for a specific variable value.
1. y = (x^2 - 5x + 6)/(x^2 + 1) , if x <= 0.5;
2. y = x^(2/3) - (x^2 - 1)^(1/3) + e^a , if x > 0.5

Also GitHub has some issues with Cyrillic symbols, therefore, some comments and lines of code may not be displayed correctly.
